# iOS Assignments Head Start

Hello there!

At '__Rent the Runway__' we know you are very busy and we appreciate that you will take the time to go thru our iOS Engineer assignment, for that reason we want to give you this pre-created project, so You can fork it and work in your solution.

The project contains the default Master-Detail example, a [PodFile], and a .gitignore file to start developing in seconds.

Once you finish your assignment, You can send it via email or simply create a pull request (Your solution would be public if you don't mind).

Don't hesitate to contact us and happy coding,


*Yours in fashion,*

__The iOS Team__
